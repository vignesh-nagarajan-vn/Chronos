# Chronos

Chronos is a full-stack web application that automatically schedules meetings on Google Calendar for large groups. It achieves this by connecting to each participant's Google Calendar, analyzing availability across the group and ranking candidate time slots using a multi-factor scoring algorithm.

## Scheduling Algorithm

The algorithm lives in `functions/scheduling/algorithm.py` and runs inside the `schedule_meeting` Cloud Function.

### Step 1: Collect availability

For each participant with a connected Google Calendar, the backend calls the Google Calendar FreeBusy API to fetch their busy intervals over the next 4 weeks.

### Step 2: Compute the shared work window

Each participant stores their work hours (start/end time + timezone) and work days in Firestore. The algorithm:

- Converts every participant's work hours to UTC using their timezone
- Takes the **latest start** and **earliest end** across all participants as the shared window for each day
- Takes the **intersection of work days** so only days everyone works are considered

### Step 3: Find candidate slots

For each valid working day, the algorithm steps through the shared window in 15-minute increments. Each candidate slot is checked against all participants' busy intervals, expanded by each person's configured buffer time (default 15 minutes). A slot is only kept if it is conflict-free for everyone and starts at least 1 hour from now.

### Step 4: Score each slot

Every passing slot receives three component scores:

**Position score (15% of total score):** The work window is divided into three equal thirds: morning, midday and afternoon. The score peaks at the center of the preferred third and decays linearly toward 0 at the opposite end.

**Buffer score (15% of total score):** Measures how much free time surrounds the slot for each participant. The gap between the slot and the nearest adjacent event on each side is measured and normalised to 0–1 (120 minutes of free time = full score of 1.0).

**Proximity score (70% of total score):** When the user specifies a target date, every slot receives a proximity score calculated as:

```
proximity = 1 / (1 + days_away_from_target)
```

**Final score:**

```
score = 0.7 * proximity_score + 0.15 * position_score + 0.15 * buffer_score
```

### Step 5: Return ranked slots

The top 5 ranked slots are returned. 


## Getting Started
